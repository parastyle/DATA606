###(a) Predicted baby weight = 120.07 - 1.93 * parity
###(b) Parody 1 = 120.07 - 1.93 or 118.14   /  Parody 0 = 120.07  / There is a 1.93 birthweight difference between first borns and latters. 
###(c) There is not a statistically signifcant relationship, I infer this from the p-value being greater than .05.

###(a) Predicted absenteeism = 18.93 - 9.11 * eth + 3.10 * sex + 2.15 * lrn
###(b) Slow learners are absent 2.15 more days than the average leaner. non-Aboriginals are absent 9.11 days more than Aboriginals. Males are absent 3.1 days more than females.  
###(c) residual = 2 - 24.18 = -22.18
###(d)
```{r}
observations = 146
variablesC = 3
resVariance = 240.57
absenteeVar = 264.17
rs = 1-(resVariance/absenteeVar)
ars = 1 -(resVariance/absenteeVar) * ( (observations-1) / (observations-variablesC-1) )
rs
ars
```

###(a) The learner variable should be removed first because the residuals show the largest variance.

###(a) We can see that if a mission took place below 64 degrees, it has at least one damaged O-ring. There seems to be a correlation between temperature and damage to O-rings. That as temperatures go higher, O-ring damage decreases.
###(b) Temperature being the explanatory variable displays a negative relationship with O-ring damage. The p-value is so close to 0, that we can induce this is not due to chance. 
###(c) ![](C:\Users\Exped\Desktop\Textbooks\606 Homeworks\Completed Homeworks\temp.png)
###(d) Well, only using the model "yes," due to the p-value. However I imagine as the missions incremented, technology regarding their safety and durability had increased as well. With a little more information, "time" could have been our explanatory variable.

###(a)
```{r}
logModel = function(temperature){
  oRing  = 11.6630 - 0.2162 * temperature
  answer = 100*(exp(oRing) / (1+exp(oRing)))
  return(answer)
}

temps = c(57,65,59,67,61,69,63,71,51,53,55)
probabilites = sapply(temps,logModel)
probabilites
```


###(b)
```{r}


plot(y=probabilites, x=temps)
curve(logModel(x), from=40,to=80,add=TRUE,xlab='o-ring damage',ylab='temperature')
```

###(c) As explained before, as temperature rises, the technology used on incremental missions increases, but we do not account for that. It may be that temperature has NO affect on o-rings; but we wouldn't know with this little information.
