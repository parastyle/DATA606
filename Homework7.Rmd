####(a) Describe the relationship between # of calories and amount of carbs that STarbucks food menu items contain.  

It's looking like a .5 correlation, moderate, positive, and linear relationship with high variability.  

####(b)What are the explanatory and response variables?  

Explanatory would be our X axis, so calories. Response is Y axis, so carbs.  

####(c) Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?

Mostly to confirm (a), easy to make predictions and see residuals with a regression line.  

####(d)Do these data meet the conditions required for fitting a least squares line?

You could use a least squares line. Wouldn't be too good though. Constant variability is an issue, and its kinda skewed to the left.

####(a) Write the equation of the regression line for predicting height

```{r}
responseMean = 171.14
responseSD = 9.41
Rvar = .67
explanatoryMean= 107.2
explanatorySD= 10.37
slope = (responseSD/explanatorySD)*Rvar
intercept = responseMean - (slope)*explanatoryMean
regressionFunction = function(x,slope,intercept){
  y =(x*slope)+ intercept
  return(y)
}
tinyGraph = 1:150
tinyGraph = sapply(tinyGraph,regressionFunction,slope,intercept)
plot(tinyGraph, type = 'l',xlab = 'Shoulder girth',ylab='height')

```
  
predicted Y  = `r intercept` + `r slope` * explanatory variable

####(b)Interpret the slope and intercept in this context

The intercept has a positive offset, slope is going up there at a .6 rate to shoulder girth.  

####(c)Calculate R2 of the regression line for predicting height from shoulder girth, and interpret it in teh context of teh application.   

`r Rvar^2`...`r 100*(Rvar^2)`% of the variability in the height is explained by the model  

####(d) A randomly selected student from your class has a shoulder girth of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.  

I'm just plugging 100 into my function (regressionFunction) I made for question (a)...`r regressionFunction(100,slope,intercept)`  

####(e) The student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the residual and explain what this means.  

Residual = observed - predicted, which for this case is `r  160-regressionFunction(100,slope,intercept)` Meaning the actual height is that much less than the line predicted.  

####(f) A one year old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?  

Original data only includes 80 to 140 shoulder girth which is a minus...Variability seems to be constant, correlation is strong and linear...While it would be innappropriate, I'd do it in absence of any other model.

#### (a) Write out the linear model.  

-.357 + 4.034 * x  

#### (b) Interpret the intercept  

We can expect that a non-existant body weight to have a negative heart weight. 

#### (c) Interpret the slope

We can expect that for each additional Kg of body weight for a cat, their heart will be 4grams heavier.

#### (d)Interpret R2  

64% of hte variability in heart weight of cats can be explained by their body weight  

#### (e) Cacluclate hte correlation coefficient

We take the square root of R2 which is  `r sqrt(.6466)`

####(a)  

3.9983 = 4.010 + b1 * -.0883  >>>>> b1 = `r  (3.9983 - 4.01)/(0.0883)`

####(b)

Yes, you can eyeball this, or look at the P-Value. Not a chance it isn't positive.

####(c)

Linearity : Weak positive linear relationship eyeballed from scatterplot - Check  
Constant Variability : Looking at residual scatterplot, check. A few outliers, nothing serious - Check  
Nearly normal residuals : Histogram shows near normal distribution, left skewed - Check  
Independent Observations * : Probably SRS compliant. - Check
